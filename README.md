# Dots and Boxes
`Dots and Boxes` is our PyGame implementation of the game of Dots and Boxes,
widely blayed in classrooms, at parties and at teatime. The game is simple enough;
two or more players take turns in drawing vertical or horizontal lines in a
square lattice, and each player scores a point when they draw the last side of
a 1x1 square. The winner is the player with the maximum score when no more lines
can be drawn.

## Walkthrough

## Working
The algorithm here is quite simple: lines are removed from a pre-written collection
of boxes as they are drawn. The incumbent player receives
a point for each _potential_ box that seems to have been removed.
## Libraries used
PyGame (v2.3.0) is the only dependency here.
## Configuration
On a computer with a Python interpreter and sufficient functionality to run PyGame,
download this repository and run `start.py`.
## How to Run
Simply execute `start.py`. Press enter to get to the grid. Click on a dot to draw a line from that dot
and click on a second, adjacent dot to complete it. Scores are on either side.
