# Project Name
`Dots and Boxes` is our PyGame implementation of the game of Dots and Boxes,
widely blayed in classrooms, at parties and at teatime. The game is simple enough;
two or more players take turns in drawing vertical or horizontal lines in a
square lattice, and each player scores a point when they draw the last side of
a 1x1 square. The winner is the player with the maximum score when no more lines
can be drawn.
